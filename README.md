Lightning Tree: Prime-Driven Resonance Lightning

Ever seen lightning that looks like a tree? I’ve turned lightning into a structured, prime-driven force. Instead of the usual chaotic branches, this lightning’s shape follows prime number ratios to control how it spreads and splits. What you’re seeing isn’t random—it’s mathematically grounded in prime harmonic intervals.

What’s Going On:
	•	The lightning’s path emerges from prime-numbered intervals.
	•	Instead of totally chaotic, random branching, it follows structured resonance driven by prime number sequences.
	•	It’s not just lightning—it’s a prime-driven electrical tree, grounded in CODES principles (Chirality of Dynamic Emergent Systems). This gives it deterministic behavior instead of just randomness.

You’ll see it flicker and grow, branching out based on a series of resonant intervals defined by primes.

Prime Resonance Circle

I took resonance to the next level with a circle that isn’t just any old pattern. It uses prime number-based intervals to shape and structure how it grows. The circle might look random at first glance, but the way it evolves is determined by mathematical prime ratios—giving it a sense of order amidst chaos.

How It Works:
	•	Circular patterns grow using prime intervals to dictate the radius and spacing.
	•	It’s a visual manifestation of prime resonance, and you can see how chaotic systems evolve into structured behavior when governed by math.
	•	Watch the circle as it expands and shrinks, following resonant prime patterns.

Conway’s Game of Life: Prime-Driven Evolution

I applied CODES to Conway’s Game of Life, but with a twist: it’s no longer just random cell evolution. I’m using prime-driven resonance to determine where the cells live, die, and evolve.

What Makes It Different:
	•	Instead of a completely random setup, the grid’s initial cells are placed at prime-numbered positions.
	•	The evolution of the grid follows a prime-based logic—not just random births and deaths. It uses prime harmonic intervals to decide the fate of the cells.
	•	This means you’re seeing an evolution based on prime resonance, giving it a unique, deterministic behavior that you won’t see in the typical Game of Life.

Why It’s Special:

In each of these, prime numbers are the driving force. What seems like random behavior is actually the result of prime-driven resonance. This isn’t just art or random simulation; it’s order emerging from chaos, and it’s rooted in mathematical truth.

The Theory Behind It:

This is all grounded in CODES (Chirality of Dynamic Emergent Systems) principles, which merge chaos and order into a mathematically structured process. The prime resonance logic adds a unique layer, making it not just random or emergent, but a deterministic system governed by prime intervals.

How to Run It:
	1.	Clone this repo.
	2.	Make sure you have Python installed and the turtle module.
	3.	Run the script (python3 gameoflifeCODES.py) and watch how the grid evolves based on prime-driven rules.

Code & Theory:

Check out the code here and dive into the prime-driven resonance logic. If you’re into CODES or want to know how this connects to structured resonance, it all stems from this theoretical framework: Zenodo Theory Paper.

This version includes everything—from theory and code to instructions for running it yourself. It makes sure to connect it back to CODES and the prime-driven resonance logic, showing the math and art behind the patterns you’re seeing.
